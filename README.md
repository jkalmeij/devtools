# Devtools

This is my attempt at documenting tools I use to make my daily development experience smoother.

You will find:

- Frequently used shortcuts for a tool
- Personal documentation of frequently used functionality of a tool
- Configuration files for a tool
- Automation scripts to make a tool more awesome
